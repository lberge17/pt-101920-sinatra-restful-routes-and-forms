# User Authentication

## Steps

- Add `bcrypt` to the gemfile
- Add `has_secure_password` to the User model
- The User must have a `password_digest` column in the database where the salted and hashed password will be stored.
- Enable sessions
- When a user has successfully authenticated themselves, store their `user.id` in the session like this: `session[:user_id] = user.id`
- Ensure that the attribute we find users by on login is a unique attribute (see validations below to add a uniqueness validation)
